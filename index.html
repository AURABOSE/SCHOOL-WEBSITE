Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram hosted an online farewell ceremony for the Class XII batch of 2020-21 on 17 April. An enthusiastic and sentimental Class XIth took great pride in organising this ceremony to bid adieu to their seniors, who are now all set to embrace the challenging world ahead. 

The event commenced with an address by the Principal, Ms Padma Srinivasan, where she inspired the students to conquer all obstacles and soar high in the limitless sky. She put forth her views about the great, winding path of life and expressed faith in her students, certain that they would handle whatever life put before them. In addition to this, she also applauded the exemplary performances of the students, appreciating them for combatting all odds, especially during this challenging academic session. 

To mark the beginning of the journey that lay before their beloved seniors, the Western Choir performed an original composition entitled ‘World of Possibilities’. This was followed by a collective and lively dance to a medley of popular songs. To further enliven and enhance the celebratory spirit of the event, students performed a humorous skit poking fun at online classes. The Hindi Choir of Class XI also added life to the evening by singing various songs. 

The Head Girls and the Head Boys expressed their heartfelt gratitude towards their Alma Mater. They also confessed to their mixed feelings on leaving this great institution that has been a source of great opportunities and has been instrumental in shaping their personalities.

The ceremony culminated with a series of recorded motivational messages by the representatives and teachers of Class XII. The boundaries of the screen may have limited this virtual event, but it did not lack the emotion and the spirit that make farewells what they have always been. </p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">An interactive session on ‘Cyber Safety-the way forward’ was organized in DPS R.K.Puram on 19 February 2021, at 10.30 am in the Audio Visual Hall. The guest speaker Mr Anuj Agarwal is a well-known Cybersecurity expert. He was introduced by Mr Amit Kaushik, Additional DCP, Delhi Police (South West District). The session started with the Principal, Ms Padma Srinivasan welcoming the audience which included both the teaching and the non-teaching staff of the school.

Mr Amit Kaushik enlightened the audience about the various dangers that students can encounter due to overexposure to the cyber world.  Students nowadays have free mobile access and are a part of various Whatsapp groups. Sometimes the parents fail to monitor their activities and this may lead them into danger. He also advised the audience to lock their Facebook pages and design cryptic passwords in order to protect their accounts on social media. Another common mode of fraud is via the OTP system. One must be careful and check the amount in an OTP while making payments so as not to get cheated by fraudsters. Also, debit cards should be swiped in front of the owner. Having the card out of one’s sight may lead to its cloning, which is dangerous.

Mr Agarwal threw light on cybersecurity by saying that customers get lured by cashback offers, free download of any book or movie, which must be avoided. He even advised the audience to keep the GPS location switched off in their phones. He also warned the audience against using public wifi connections, which are definitely a threat to our security. Mr. Agarwal advised that the firewall installed in our computers and mobile phones should not be removed at any time. He also stressed the importance of counselling parents about the dangers of cybercrime so that they are better equipped to counsel their wards.

The session was very interactive and many staff members had queries related to security in their phones and laptops. The interaction provided a lot of useful information.</p>
